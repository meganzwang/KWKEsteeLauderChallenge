# Kode With Klossy Estee Lauder Challenge Submission

## Description

This project, completed in July 2021 as a part of Kode with Klossy summer programming, marks the very beginning of my coding journey!
Through this initial exploratory project, I aimed to create a simple interactive web application to market one of Estee Lauder's new skincare lines. 
While this project is severely lacking in good practice and sophistication by my current standards, I've since come a long way and am pushing this project to showcase a personal foundational milestone for future reference.
